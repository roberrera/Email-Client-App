## Exercise

In this lab, you will be using [Google's Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/) to create an email app.

The app should have an inbox, and a way of viewing the email's contents. The app should also account for tablet devices.

You should take a look at the [Android Quickstart Guide](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/android) to get started.

The requirement is to "make an email client app," but the design and functionality of the app is yours to choose! For instance, [Google's Inbox](https://www.google.com/inbox/) app is an email client, but added one-click functionality that makes it easy to empty the inbox of unnecessary emails. As long as you can view a list of a user's emails, and view the contents of the emails, then you can add whatever you would like.

Note: We suggest using Google's Gmail API. However, points will not be taken away if you use another API to access a user's email. So, if you find another API that you find easier to use, or more straight forward, or more difficult if you are a masochist, then go ahead!

#### Requirements

Your email clients must show/do the following:

* A list of emails in a user's inbox
* A screen for viewing the contents of an email
  * ... which is seen when clicking an item in the list of emails
* On tablets, in landscape, both the master list of emails in the inbox and the details of a selected email should be visible.
  * You should use a master/detail layout!
* Be able to compose and send emails
* Must use a class, like _Email.java_, that defines the email objects

#### Bonuses

Though not required, try to aim for the following goals:

* Use material design :)
* Add a way to save drafts of emails
* Add a way to search emails
* Add functionality where you can select different accounts and view their emails

If you add anything else you find to be spectacular and bonus-worthy, add it below and we'll evaluate it:

* *Extra bonus 1*
* *Extra bonus 2*
* *Extra bonus 3*
* *etc.*

#### Deliverable

An Android Studio application that meets the above requirements.

When making your pull requests, make sure the title contains your name. It makes it easier to search for us.
